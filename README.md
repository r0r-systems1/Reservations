Development notes below:

Reservatiosn system should be as automated as we can get it.
A number of selection lists or buttons from which the prospective attendee can choose:

-The event type: Full event, 1 day special which could be day 1 or day 2 or day 3. 

-Personal data such as Adult, Youth, Child, Pensioner/student, etc

-Earlybird or late booking, where each is a set amount according to Personal data above.

Fees are entered into the database by event coordinators and displayed to the registering attendee according to the choices above.

Events are entered into the database by the Australian events coordinators.

The registering attendee can see the prescribed fee but may instead make a donation of any amount in whole dollarrs only
